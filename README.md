# Keylogger
This is a simple Python-based keylogger built using the pynput library. The script captures keystrokes and logs them to a text file (keyfilelog.txt).  

## Note: This script is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Please ensure that you have explicit permission to use this tool.


## Features
- Captures and logs all keystrokes in real-time.
- Handles exceptions gracefully to ensure smooth logging.
- Stores keystrokes in a file named keyfilelog.txt.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pynput library

## Usage
Here are some real-world scenarios where a keylogger could be legally and ethically used:

### 1. Parental Monitoring:
Parents can use keyloggers to monitor their childrenâ€™s online activity to ensure their safety.

### 2. Employee Activity Monitoring:
Employers may use keyloggers to track employee activity on company-owned devices, provided it complies with workplace policies and laws.

### 3. Personal Device Monitoring:
Individuals can use keyloggers to monitor activity on their own devices for security purposes, such as tracking unauthorized access.

### 4. Testing and Debugging:
Keyloggers can be used by developers for debugging purposes, such as testing keyboard input handling in applications.

### 5. Education and Awareness:
Educators and cybersecurity professionals may use keyloggers to demonstrate how they work, teaching ethical hacking and cybersecurity awareness.

Reminder: Always comply with local laws and obtain consent when using a keylogger in any real-world application.

## Code Explanation
### keyPressed function: 
Captures key presses and logs them to the file. It uses a try-except block to handle exceptions, such as special keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl).
### Keyboard Listener: 
Listens for keypress events and calls the keyPressed function for each event.
